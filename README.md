# VoiceKom Library

VoiceKom is a powerful, lightweight JavaScript library that lets you seamlessly add voice interaction to any existing web application.
It runs fully on the client side and uses advanced Speech-to-Text (STT) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) ‚Äî enabling users to speak naturally and control page elements in a given web apps easily.

**Speak Naturally ‚Äî VoiceKom Understands You**
VoiceKom is built to understand the way people actually speak ‚Äî not just rigid commands. It lets users interact with forms and interfaces using natural, conversational language.
Whether you're filling out a form, selecting an option, or submitting data ‚Äî just say it the way you would in real life, and VoiceKom takes care of the rest.

| Voice Command                                                   | Action Performed                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Can you please enter the name as John Smith?                   | Fills the name field with ‚ÄúJohn Smith‚Äù                  |
| Set the gender to female                                       | Selects the ‚Äúfemale‚Äù radio button                       |
| Choose marketing as the department                             | Selects ‚ÄúMarketing‚Äù from dropdown                       |
| Set the date as next Friday                                    | Interprets and fills the date picker                    |
| Set the time as six hours from now                             | Interprets and fills the time picker                    |
| Fill in email with john@example.com and click submit           | Fills email and triggers submit                         |
| Enter my phone number as zero double seven...                  | Converts speech to digits and fills phone               |
| Scroll down and click register                                 | Scrolls the page and clicks "Register"                  |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Installation

Add the following script tag to your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://voicekom.embla.asia/dist/voicekom.min.js"></script>
```

### 2. Attribute Setup

To help VoiceKom identify and interact with the correct elements on your page, you should decorate them with the `voicekom.name` attribute in relavant elements.

For example:

```html
<input type="text" voicekom.name="fullName" />
<select voicekom.name="gender">...</select>
<button voicekom.name="submit">Submit</button>
```

### 3. Initialization

VoiceKom's transcription and recognition services can be configured independently, allowing you to create a hybrid setup tailored to your specific needs. You can mix providers to balance speed, privacy, and intelligence.

The following are different ways you can instantiate VoiceKom, depending on your setup and preferred configuration style:

##### 3.1. Zero-Config Mode
You don‚Äôt need any configuration to get started ‚Äî just instantiate the library, and VoiceKom will initialize with all default settings:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  VoiceKom.init()
});
```

Uses the built-in browser-based transcriber and recognizer
Automatically injects a mic widget at the bottom-right of your page

Say "Hello" to activate it ‚Äî then start giving voice commands

üõ†Ô∏è No API keys, no setup required

##### 3.2 Custom-Browser Mode

VoiceKom can run **entirely in the browser** without any external AI dependencies. In this mode:
- Offers **faster response**
- Ensures **maximum privacy**
- May be **less accurate** in transcriptions compared to exernal services
- May have **less flexibility** compared to external engines and is less flexible for complex or nuanced language understanding compared to LLM-powered alternatives.

This mode is ideal if you want speed, and privacy without compromising usability.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  VoiceKom.init({   
    lang: 'en-US', // Set the language
    wakeWords: ['Hello','Hey'],
    sleepWords: ['Stop', 'Bye'],
    position: 'bottom-left',
    width: '200px',
    height: '75px',
    styles: { 'border' : '2px solid green',
              'font-size' : '15px'
            }
  })
});
```

#### 3.3 External AI Mode

If you wish to use external AI engines such as **OpenAI** for transcription and recognition, you will need to provide your own API keys.
- Offers slightly **slower response** due to external API calls
- Has **low privacy**
- Much more **accurate** due to renowned external Speech to Text services
- Much more **flexible** for complex or nuanced language understanding compared to LLM-powered alternatives.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Supplying API keys directly in the frontend is **insecure** and not recommended for production environments. This method should only be used for local development or testing.


Specify the provider (e.g., `'whisper'` for transcription, `'openai'` for recognition) and supply your API key.

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  VoiceKom.init({   
    lang: 'en-US', // Set the language
    transcription: {
      provider: 'whisper',
      apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'  // Transcription provider API key
    },
    recognition: {
      provider: 'openai', 
      apiKey: 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'  // Recognition provider API key
    },    
  })
});
```

#### 3.4 Secure Proxy Mode (Recommended)

If you still prefer using services like OpenAI **without exposing your API key**, we can help:
Contact us to set up a **Tenant profile** for you. We'll route your requests through our **proxied API**, keeping your keys safe
- Offers **a bit less slower response** due to api calls
- Has **strong privacy** thanks to domain-verified API access
- Significantly **more accurate** using external speech-to-text services
- Highly **flexible** for handling complex or nuanced language, outperforming many LLM-based options


Once your Tenant profile is set up, initialize VoiceKom by setting the `provider` as `'voicekom'` and using your provided VoiceKom client Id as API key. 
The client ID will be validated against the configured profile to ensure secure usage

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  VoiceKom.init({   
    lang: 'en-US', // Set the language
    transcription: {
      provider: 'voicekom',
      apiKey: 'VOICEKOM_CLIENT_ID'  // Your VoiceKom API key
    },
    recognition: {
      provider: 'voicekom', 
      apiKey: 'VOICEKOM_CLIENT_ID'  // Your VoiceKom API key
    },    
  })
});
```


## 4. API & Configuration

The `VoiceKom.init(config)` method accepts a single configuration object. All parameters are optional and have sensible defaults unless stated otherwise.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |

## üó£Ô∏è Supported Commands

VoiceKom's command recognition capability depends on the `recognition.provider` you select in your configuration. Each provider offers a different balance of speed, flexibility, and intelligence.

### Default Provider
*(**Config:** `recognition: { provider: 'default' }`)*

The `default` provider is a fast, lightweight, and offline-first engine. It operates on a strict set of command patterns and is designed for simple, direct instructions. It is not conversational and expects commands to be given one at a time in a specific format.

| Intent | Command Structure | Alternative Verbs | Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Clicking Elements | `Click <element name>` | `Press` | `"Click submit"`<br>`"Press the login button"` |
| Filling Text Fields | `Fill <field name> with <text to enter>`| `Enter`, `As` | `"Fill username with John Doe"`<br>`"Enter password as 123456"` |
| Typing in Text Areas | `Type in <field name> as <text>` | `In` | `"Type in message as this is a great product"` |
| Checking/Unchecking | `Check <checkbox name>` <br> `Uncheck <checkbox name>` <br> `Check all <group name>` <br> `Uncheck all <group name>` | - | `"Check agree to terms"`<br>`"Uncheck newsletter"`<br>`"Check all interests"` |
| Selecting from Lists | `Select <option name> in <list name>` <br> `Open <dropdown name>` | `Choose` | `"Select Norway in country"`<br>`"Open the state dropdown"` |
| Navigating | `Scroll <direction>` <br> `Scroll to <element name>` <br> `Scroll to the <position>` | `Go to` | `"Scroll down"`<br>`"Scroll to the footer"`<br>`"Go to the top"` |

**Note:** The terms in `<...>` are placeholders for the name of the UI element (e.g., its label, placeholder) or the value you want to use.



### OpenAI Provider
*(**Config:** `recognition: { provider: 'openai', apiKey: '...' }`)*

When using the `openai` provider, VoiceKom becomes a powerful conversational assistant. This provider is slower as it requires an internet connection, but it can understand natural language, context, and even multiple commands in a single, continuous utterance.

You can be as natural as you want, as long as your intent is clear.
> ‚ÄúName is Alex, email is alex@gmail.com, phone number 071662, preferred date tomorrow, preferred time is 3 hrs from now. Select phone in preferred contact method. Check everything except upcoming events in interests. Select feedback in subject. Type Good morning Alex in message. I agree to terms and conditions. Finally, submit.‚Äù

#### üí° Best Practices for the OpenAI Provider:
*   **Be Clear with Your Intent:** If you want to select from a list, use a verb like "select" or "choose". Saying "country is Sri Lanka" might be interpreted as typing into an input field named "country". A clearer command would be "**Select** country Sri Lanka".
*   **Checkboxes vs. Selections:** Checking a checkbox within a group is a distinct action. For a group of radio buttons, use "select" or "choose". For checkboxes, use "check" or "uncheck".

### How VoiceKom Finds Elements
For both providers, VoiceKom intelligently finds UI elements on the page based on their `aria-label`, `placeholder` text, the text content of an associated `<label>`, or the text inside a button.


## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Architecture)

VoiceKom is built on a modular, with an expandable driver-based structure, allowing key components to be easily swapped or extended. separates concerns for maximum maintainability and extensibility.

The core flow is as follows:

1. **UI Component**: Captures the user's intent to speak (e.g., clicking a microphone button).

2. **Audio Capturer**: Uses the browser's MediaDevices API to capture audio from the user's microphone.

3. **Transcription Driver (Whisper)**: Sends the captured audio to Speech-to-Text service (e.g: Whisper API) and receives a text transcription.

4. **Intent Recognition Driver (OpenAI)**: Sends the transcripted text to an AI service (e.g: OpenAI API) which processes and returns a structured JSON object identifying the user's intent (e.g., `FILL_INPUT`) and the entities (e.g., `target: "name"`, `value: "John"`).

5. **Voice Actuator**: Receives the structured command and performs the corresponding action on the DOM, such as finding the correct element and dispatching a click or input event.

This entire process is managed by a **Core Module** that orchestrates the data flow between components.
